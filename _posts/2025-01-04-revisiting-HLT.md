A previous DWP-funded study of Health-Led Trials tested the 12-month impacts of Individual Placement and Support on the employment, health and well-being of people whose health condition presented an obstacle to finding or remaining in employment. This new study expands the original evaluation in two ways: evaluating new outcomes (using updated HMRC/DWP data to estimate longer-term impacts on employment and earnings, as well as impacts on self-employment) and assessing impact heterogeneity (using machine learning techniques to explore how impacts vary across individuals, as well as examining the scope to target the programme to maximise returns).
