This project evaluates a pilot programme that embeds teams of specialists (e.g., mental health workers, speech and language therapists, family support workers) in alternative provision settings.  The pilot operates within serious violence hotspots in England and the evaluation will assess the impact on engagement with education as well as social and emotional outcomes and conduct and hyperactivity symptoms.
