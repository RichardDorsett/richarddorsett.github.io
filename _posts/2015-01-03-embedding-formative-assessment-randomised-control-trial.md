This project tests the effects on GCSE outcomes of a two-year "formative assessment" development programme.  Formative assessment involves teachers using evidence of pupils' understanding and learning to make decisions about the next steps in teaching and learning.  This evidence can also be used when planning lessons or differentiating activities for individual pupils.  The development programme uses an "Embedding Formative Assessment" (EFA) pack, which provides the materials schools need in order to deliver 18 monthly internal workshops.  These workshops involve all teachers within the school, working together in groups of 8-12.  The programme is being evaluated as a randomised trial, with participating schools randomly assigned to a treatment (EFA) group or a control group.
