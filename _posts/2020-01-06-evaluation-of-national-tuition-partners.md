The National Tuition Programme, delivered over the 2020/21 academic year, comprises two elements - Tuition Partners and Academic Mentoring.  It is targeted at disadvantaged pupils needing catch-up support and forms part of the government's COVID catch-up plan to tackle the impact of school closures and lost teaching time in English schools. This project estimates the impact of the two NTP strands on attainment.
