This project examines local labour markets and the extent to which they appear to rebound from the economic shock of COVID19.  The results provide insights into the extent to which local labour markets post-COVID differ from before and the extent of variation across local areas in the degree of mismatch, with implications for labour market policy and the levelling-up agenda.  Using Labour Force Survey and vacancy data, it begins with descriptive statistics and progresses to an econometric model of transitions between successive quarters using two-quarter longitudinal LFS.  Controlling for trend and seasonal effects, it focuses on the relationship between local labour market demand (as captured using vacancy data) and labour market transitions.  The analysis will consider transitions between three states - employment, unemployment, inactivity.
