This programme of randomised trials aims to establish whether providing a social worker to supervise Designated Safeguarding Leads (DSLs) in schools affects the quality of referrals to social services . The first trial (completed) focused on primary schools in Bolton (see [protocol](https://osf.io/gw56u/)).  Subsequent (ongoing) trials extend this to secondary schools in Greater Manchester ([protocol](https://whatworks-csc.org.uk/research-project/supervision-for-designated-safeguarding-leads-scale-up/)) and to primary schools in 10 local authorities across England.  A further trial - involving primary and secondary schools - evaluates an adapted version of the programme that has a specific focus on supporting DSLs in better identifying possible indicators of child sexual abuse and how to approproriately respond.
