For young people facing obstacles to employment, self-employment may offer a viable alernative. This project aims to understand how self-employment features among young people. Through a review of the relevant literature and an analysis of a range of datasets, we provide new evidence on who enters self-employment and when, as well as the pathways they follow to get there. Through consultation with young people and training providers, we attempt to identify a novel package of support that would be both attractive and viable to deliver. The project will culminate in a protocol to evaluate the identified intervention.
