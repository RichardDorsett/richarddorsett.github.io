This paper examines how young people's early transitions into the labour market have changed between cohorts born in 1958, 1970, 1980, and 1990. We use sequence analysis to characterise transition patterns and identify three distinct pathways in all cohorts: those who have a more-or-less smooth transition into employment; those who remain in education; and those whose experiences are potentially more of a concern in the sense that they appear not to achieve either of these.  We examine how the predictors of being in one rather than another of these groups have changed over time, and demonstrate that these early transitions are highly predictive of longer-term outcomes.
