The New Deal for Young People (NDYP) was introduced in 1998 and was designed to help young (18-24 year old) unemployed people into employment and to increase their long-term employability.  After six months on NDYP, individuals were required to participate in one of four Options: subsidised employment; full-time education and training; voluntary sector work placement; or the Environmen Task Force.  This project used survey data combined with benefit records and data from those delivering the NDYP to estimate the relative effect of the Options on labour market outcomes.  These estimates followed a propensity score matching methodology, one of the first applications of this approach in the UK.
