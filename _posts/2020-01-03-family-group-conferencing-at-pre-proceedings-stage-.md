This project seeks to evaluate referring families for Family Group Conferences (FGCs) at pre-proceedings, as part of the Department for Education funded Supporting Families: Investing in Practice programme, which is expanding and rolling out promising interventions that came through the DfE's Innovation Programme. The evaluation consists of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and a process evaluation.
