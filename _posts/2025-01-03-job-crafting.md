This project investigates whether `job crafting' can help disabled workers stay in employment. Disabled workers are twice as likely to fall out of work as non-disabled workers, and report a range of problems when trying to get workplace accommodations to help them perform to their best at work. Job crafting emphasises the proactive role an employee can take in asserting control over their work to adapt their jobs to align better with their strengths, skills or interests, boosting satisfaction, productivity, sustainability and wellbeing in the workplace as a result.
