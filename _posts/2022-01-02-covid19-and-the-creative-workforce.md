SAFE (Support, Attend, Fulfil, Exceed) taskforces constitute a targeted, schools-led programme directing evidence-based interventions (e.g. social and emotional learning, therapeutic support) at young people in most need, by engaging active support from local partners and giving clear lines of accountability to schools and local authorities. This evaluation will assess the impact of the taskforces on serious violence and engagement with education.
